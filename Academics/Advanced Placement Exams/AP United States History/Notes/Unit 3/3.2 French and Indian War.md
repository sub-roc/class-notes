### Causes

- European countries had tried to control as much land and as much trade as possible
- Triangle of Hatred developed between England, France, and Spain
- The secret to success in 18th century seemed to be trade + gold = wealth + power
- French antagonized the English by building forts in the Ohio River Valley
    - French had better relations with Indigenous peoples compared to the English
- French also built forts to keep English from expanding (hemming in)

### Major Events

- English sent professional soldiers to America in late 1754
    - Led by Gen. Edward Braddock
- Braddock led ~2000 British soldiers and colonial militia to French Fort Duquesne in June of 1755
    - Britain claimed Ohio for itself
- Maj. George Washington was sent to warn the French to leave the region
- A fight broke out and a third of the troops at Duquesne were killed by a patrol led by Washington
- Washington and co. built Fort Necessity which was quickly taken by the French
- British performance improved after William Pitt became Secretary of State and then PM
- Pitt sent Britain’s best assets to the Colonies
- British and local Indigenous peoples signed Treaty of Easton
    - Promised no new settlements west of the Alleghenies

### Consequences

- Benjamin Franklin proposed the Albany Plan for unity among the colonies
    - No colony agreed
- The Treaty of Paris ended the war in 1763
    - French land east of the Mississippi River went to the British
        - Including the entirety of Canada
    - Spain gave Florida to Britain
    - France gave Louisiana Territory to Spain
- Britain became a global superpower
- Americans gained valuable combat experience
- Americans soon renege on the Treaty of Easton and colonize west of the Alleghenies

### Pontiac’s Rebellion

- Occurred as a result of the Americans breaking the Treaty of Easton
- Pan-Indigenous resistance against European colonization
- Forced a recognition of Indigenous rights and caused the British to give into demands to tighten controls on colonial expansion
