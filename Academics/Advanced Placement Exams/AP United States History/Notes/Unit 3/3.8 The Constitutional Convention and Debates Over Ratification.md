- [[3.7 The Articles of Confederation#Weaknesses|Several problems]] led to a convention and debates over a new constitution
- Washington held a conference at his home in Mount Vernon, VA in 1785
    - Representatives from VA, MD, DE, and PA agreed to meet later at Annapolis, MD
- Five states sent delegates to the Annapolis Convention in 1786
    - Discussions over commercial relations between states
    - Decided to meet again in PA to revise the Articles of Confederation

### Philadelphia Convention

- All states other than RI sent delegates to Philadelphia
    - All were White, male, and mostly were college-educated and on average in their early fourties
- First order of business was to elect a presiding officer and decide on publicly communicating
    - Decided to conduct meetings in secret
    - George Washington was unanimously elected chairperson
- Work in writing the Constitution was directed by J. Madison, A. Hamilton, Gouverneur Morris, and John Dickinson

### Key Issues
#### Government Power
- Delegates such as Madison and Hamilton (nationalists) believed in federalism (strong but limited central gov’t)
- Many delegates believed in separation of powers (as safeguard against corruption like w/ state gov’t)
    - Power of each branch would be limited by those of the others ([[3.4 Philosophical Foundations of the American Revolution#Government|checks and balances à la Montesquieu]])
- Madison proposed that states like Virginia and Mass. have more power (Virginia Plan)
- Countered by the New Jersey Plan which favoured the smaller states
- Roger Sherman of Connecticut proposed the CT. Plan a.k.a. the Great Compromise
        - Bicameral (two-house) Congress
        - Equal representation in the Senate
        - Proportional representation in the House of Representatives
#### Slavery
-  Southerners argued they should for purposes of more representation in the House
- Northerners disagreed since they did not have rights
- Agreed to the Three-Fifths Compromise
	- A slave is legally ⅗ of a person for tax and representation purposes
- Some delegates wanted to ban slavery for humanitarian reasons, others were concerned about labour
	- Decided to guarantee legality of importing slaves until 1808, Congress could then vote for abolition
#### Commerce
- Commercial Compromise allowed Congress to regulate interstate/foreign commerce incl. tariffs (+ north) but couldn’t place taxes on exports like tobacco and rice (+ south)
#### Government
- Delegates limited the president’s term to four years without limit on the number of terms
- Decided to assign each state a number of electors equal to the number of House reps and senators (Electoral College)
- Gave the president immense power including vetoing acts of Congress
- Ratified on Sep. 17, 1787
    - Went to the states to agree
    - Delegates specified in Article VII that only nine states needed to be in favour

### Federalism

- Supporters of the Constitution were called Federalists
- People who feared that the new government would be too strong were called Anti-Federalists (basically in support of the Articles)
	- Wanted a [[3.7 The Articles of Confederation#Articles of Confederation|weak gov't with more power to the states]]
	- Wanted to ensure that Americans would not fall victim to the government [[3.3 Taxation Without Representation#Coercive/Intolerable Acts|like with the British]]
- Federalists were mainly on the Atlantic Coast and in large cities, Anti-Federalists were mainly farmers and western settlers
- The Federalist Papers (by Madison, Hamilton, Jay) presented 85 essays on reasons to believe in the Constitution

### Ratification
- Anti-Federalists pointed out that the Constitution didn’t mention any inalienable rights
- Federalists responded that the people would be protected by their ability to elect Congress
     - Still agreed to add a bill of rights to win support for ratification
- New Hampshire voted in favour of ratification in June of 1788, ninth state to agree
    - Still needed to wait for large VA and NY to ensure national unity in strength
        - VA Anti-Federalists viewed the Constitution as threats to American liberty
        - Washington, Madison, and John Marshall barely won the ratification vote after promising a bill of rights
        - VA ratifying led to NY’s ratifying convention winning
- NC (11/1789) and RI (05/1790) reversed their rejections
- All states ended up ratifying the Constitution
