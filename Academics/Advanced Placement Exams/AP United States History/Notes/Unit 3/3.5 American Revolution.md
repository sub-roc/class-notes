### Economics

- Britain imposed numerous financial (Tax Acts) and colonial acts (Proclamation of 1763, Intolerable Acts) on the colonies (see [[3.3 Taxation Without Representation]])

### Philosophy

* The rejection of the [Olive Branch Petition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Branch_Petition) and the [[3.4 Philosophical Foundations of the American Revolution|Enlightenment movement]] led to rising support for the revolution

    - Used biblical analogies to show the folly of monarchy, spread Enlightenment ideas to common people
