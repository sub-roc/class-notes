- Possible use of pathetic fallacy on line 2: “In thunder, lightning, or in rain?”
- Creepy/volatile weather hints towards impending danger
- The three witches reveal that they know when the war in Scotland will end (1.1.3)
	- "That will be ere (before) the set of sun" (1.1.5)
### Plot

- Three witches (the Weird Sisters) are talking about when they should next meet
- The second sister offers to meet when the hurly-burly (battle) is over, upon a heath (open land) at sunset to meet Macbeth
	- This is where Macbeth will be fighting a civil war
- The first and second witches mention Graymalkin (a gray cat) and Paddock (a toad), their familiar spirits
- Familiar spirits are demons that help witches with their evil work
- Witches chant the line “fair is foul, and foul is fair” (1.1.12)
	- Paradox
- Encapsulates a major theme that appearances can be deceiving
- Line shows that good can be bad and bad can be good
