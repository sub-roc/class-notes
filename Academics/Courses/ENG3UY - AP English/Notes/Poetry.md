# **Meter and Rhyme:**

- A foot is the basic unit of meter
- Feet _usually_ consist of one stressed syllable and one or more unstressed syllables

## Common feet in poetry:

- Iambus - u/ (one unstressed followed by one stressed)
    - E.g. aMUSE, reTURN
- Anapest - uu/ (two unstressed followed by one stressed)
    - E.g. underSTAND, compreHEND
- Trochee - /u (one stressed followed by one unstressed)
    - E.g. pittsBURGH, douBLE
- Dactyl - /uu (one stressed followed by two unstressed)
    - E.g. HORRible, CAREfully

## Feet for variation:

- Spondee - / / (two stressed)
- Pyrrhic - u u (two unstressed)
- Amphibrach - u/u (unstressed, stressed, unstressed)
- Monosyllabic - / (one stressed)

## Types of meter:

- Meter is named with the number of feet in a meter and the type of rhyme
- For example, trochaic tetrameter has four (tetra) feet with four trochees
- Iambic pentameter has five (penta) feet with five iambs

## Prefixes:

1 - mono

2 - di

3 - tri

4 - tetra

5 - penta

6 - hexa

7 - hepta

8 - octo

9 - nona

10 - deca

# **Forms of Poetry:**

## Stanzaic forms:

- Couplet - two lines rhyming _aa_
- Tercet - three lines, rhyming _aba_ or _bab_
- Quatrain - four lines in some sort of rhyme structure

## Sonnets:

- Consists of fourteen lines and written in a rhyme scheme following one of two patterns
    - Petrarchan: split into an octave and a sestet
        - abbaabba cdecde
    - Shakespearean: split into three quatrains and a couplet
        - abab cdcd efef gg
- Uses iambic pentameter (10 syllables, 5 iambus)

## Tercet poems:

- A set of three lines rhyming together
- Know three main types of poems using tercets:
    - Villanelle
        - Type of poem with 5 tercets (aba) and 1 quatrain (abaa)
        - First and third lines of one tercet are the last lines of the second and third tercet, respectively
            - If you don’t get that look at Thomas’s _Don’t Go Gentle Into That Good Night_
        - First and third lines are repeated as third and fourth lines in the quatrain
    - Terza Rima
        - Interlocking rhyme pattern (aba, bcb, cdc, ded)
        - See P.B. Shelley’s _Ode To The West Wind_
    - Monorhyming
        - Tercets with one rhyme each (aaa, bbb, ccc, etc.)
        - See Tennyson’s _The Eagle_

## Pantoums:

- Grouped into quatrains (stanzas of 4 lines)
- Final line of the poem = first line
- No set number of quatrains
- No set foot and meter
- ABAB rhyme scheme
- The first line of one quatrain is the same as the second in the prior quatrain
- The third line in one quatrain is the same as the fourth in the prior quatrain
- Example: _The Larger Bowl_

## Free verse:

- No holds barred on structure
- No set meter, rhythm, syllable count, etc.
- Lines don’t even need to rhyme
- See Downie’s _Secret Path_
